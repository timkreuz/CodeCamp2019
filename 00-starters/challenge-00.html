    <h1>UFO Invaders: The Game</h1></br>

    <pre>
    <strong>Backstory:</strong> 
    The presence of aliens visiting our planet and abducting
    small animals has been a known fact for sometime. But their master 
    plan is to colonize our planet in a hostile takeover.  In this game
    the attack begins.  Fortunately an alien defense system exists to
    prevent the alients from bringing death and destruction.
    </pre></br>


    <pre>
    Here's how the game will work:
    </pre></br>

    <pre>
    The aliens win if they get 10 visitors to land on the earth.
    This is their magic number required to overpower the planet. 
    </pre></br>

    <pre>
    The humans win if they can successfully destroy the UFO.
    </pre></br>
             
    <pre>
    The UFO will begin with 5 energy. 
    It will lose one energy each time the earth's defense system hits it with a missile.
    However, it will gain one energy each time it successfully abducts a small animal.</pre>
    </pre></br>

    <pre>
    The earth's defense system will be equipped with a missile launcher used to try and
    destroy the UFO. It will also be equipped with an abduction shield to block the
    UFO from consuming small animals. Like cats.
    </pre></br>

    <pre>
    However, if the abduction beam hits the defense system three times, then it is
    destroyed and it's game over for the humans.
    </pre></br>

    <pre>
    The beam moves fast. But it does give a three second warning. So the humans will
    need to act quick to get in position and activate the shields. Or stay out of the way!
    </pre></br>
