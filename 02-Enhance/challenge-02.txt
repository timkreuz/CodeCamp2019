Challenge #2 - 

    There's a lot more to do yet.  But we need to slow things down
    and improve our program.  This will set things up for the all the other other
    things we need to do.

    The first problem is we're going to be drawing a lot more objects - like 
    abductioin beams, and defense systems and missiles and shields and alien invaders.
    And that's going be a lot of ctx begin, draw, fill, etc... There's got to be a 
    better way.  

    The second problem is all we can draw right night is boring rectangles.  What if 
    we want to draw an ellipse, or a more complex object or display a cool image.
    So we'll fix that too.

    Those are the main things.  And along the way, we'll learn how to do arrays, loops,
    and ifs with elses and ifs with ors and other fun programming things.


Goal #1 - Improve the ufo change direction code.

    Whether you hit the left of right side of the wall, you always change directions
    by multiplying the speed by -1.  Let's add an or statement to that code.  || 
    means "or" in javascript.  

        if ((ufo.x + ufo.width > ufo.maxRight) || (ufo.x < ufo.maxLeft))
        ufo.speedX = ufo.speedX * -1;

    Now do the same for the up and down direction changes.

    Make sure everything is still working.

Goal #2 - Consolidate those draw functions in main.js

    Create a drawObject function.

    function drawObject(object) {
        //guess what goes here!  
    }

    And guess what you can delete now.  And what needs to change.

Goal #3 - Too many calls to drawObject

    Things are a lot better now.  What if we have a 50 objects to draw? 
    It's going to get tiring having a long list of drawObject statemments.
    Let's fix that.

    Step #1 - Let's create a collection of drawables.
        
        Do this near the top after we create these things.
        var drawables = [earth, sky, ufo];

    Step #2 - Create a new function called drawAll

        function drawAll(drawables) {
        
        }

    Step #3 - Inside of drawAll we can write a loop.

        There's other ways to do this, but we'll learn this first.

        for (i = 0; i < drawables.length; i++) {
            drawObject(drawables[i]);
        }

    Step #4 - Remove the drawObjects in the draw function.
        Instead drawAll.

        If you want you can put all the drawing code in drawAll.  It's 
        up to you.  And maybe renamme draw to updateAndDraw.


Goal #4 - Set things up to draw more than rectangles.
